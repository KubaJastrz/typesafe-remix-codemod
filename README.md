> This is only a concept image, the actual codemod doesn't fully work like this yet. It's close though ðŸ˜„

## Usage

I don't know how to package this yet, but you can run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KubaJastrz/typesafe-remix-codemod
cd typesafe-remix-codemod
cargo run ./remix-app  # or path to any other remix app
```

## How it works

The codemod finds all route files with `npx -y @remix-run/dev routes --json` and iterates over them with [oxc_parser](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/parser.html).

It makes transformations in two passes per file. The first one is to modify the existing function bodies and remove the `useLoaderData`/`useActionData` hook calls. The second pass is to replace all Remix exports with the new `defineRoute` default export.

## Contributing

```bash
# run against local remix app
cargo run ./remix-app

# revert codemod changes
git restore ./remix-app

# test
cargo test

# review snapshots
cargo insta review
```

### Todo

- [x] indent the result
- [ ] remove those ugly empty lines
- [ ] add import for `defineRoutes` at the top of the file
- [ ] read the `app` dir from config somehow, right now it is hardcoded
- [ ] read and inject `params` array (from the filepath? from the sourcecode?)
- [x] remove useLoaderData altogether https://x.com/pcattori/status/1798355710968844784
- [ ] remove useActionData altogether (where to put action data?)
- [ ] remove `LoaderFunctionArgs` from `loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs)`
- [ ] support `clientLoader.hydrate = true`
